# House Price Prediction using Ridge and Lasso Model
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 

### The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
How well those variables describe the price of a house.

## General Information

### Business Goal 
You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Best alpha value for Lasso : {'alpha': 100}
- Best alpha value for Ridge : {'alpha': 5.0}

Here is the conclusion that, after compairing both the model we can say that the below features are best explaining the DataSet.
- OverallCond_3
- OverallQual_10
- Neighborhood_Timber
- GarageType_Attchd
- BsmtExposure_Mn
- Neighborhood_NridgHt
- RoofStyle_Gable
- Exterior1st_BrkComm
- Neighborhood_Edwards
- ExterQual_Fa

## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.8.8
- Jupyter Note
- Git Bash.

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->

## Acknowledgements
Give credit here.
- This project was inspired to understand the management, how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
